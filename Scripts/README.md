# AdvaniaGIT
Source Control Management for NAV C/AL

Script Folder

TestDevel.ps1 can be used to debug the scripts.
Every action will start by calling Start-CustomAction from the GIT client.

When debugging in Administration mode open PowerShell ISE in Administration mode and run the scripts with InAdminMode = $false

Scripts in the folder Cloud.Ready.Software.NAV are downloaded from https://github.com/waldo1001/Cloud.Ready.Software.PowerShell
Some of the scripts in the AdvaniaGIT folder are inspired or copied from Kamil Sacke (https://github.com/kine)
